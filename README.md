# Demo Microservice Application

This is a sample microservice application you can use as a sandbox to test and learn containerised application orchestration and monitoring techniques. 

You can get more detailed information from this [blog post](https://www.instana.com/blog/stans-robot-shop-sample-microservice-application/) about this sample microservice application.

This sample microservice application has been built using these technologies:
- NodeJS ([Express](http://expressjs.com/))
- Java ([Spring Boot](https://spring.io/))
- Python ([Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org))
- Golang
- PHP (Apache)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- MySQL ([Maxmind](http://www.maxmind.com) data)
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx
- AngularJS (1.x)

## Run Locally

Run locally on Kubernetes using minikube cluster.
Follow initial-cluster-setup.ps1 script to start a cluster and setup essential components :

```shell
$ .\initial-cluster-setup.ps1
```


## Prometheus

The cart and payment services both have Prometheus metric endpoints. These are accessible on `/metrics`. The cart service provides:

* Counter of the number of items added to the cart

The payment services provides:

* Counter of the number of items purchased
* Histogram of the total number of items in each cart
* Histogram of the total value of each cart

To test the metrics use:

```shell
$ curl http://<host>:8080/api/cart/metrics
$ curl http://<host>:8080/api/payment/metrics
```
